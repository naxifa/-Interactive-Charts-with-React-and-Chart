# -Interactive-Charts-with-React-and-Chart


Business Case
Scenario:
A data analytics company needs a dashboard to visualize financial data dynamically. The dashboard must include various charts for sales, profits, expenses, and trends, offering an interactive experience for stakeholders.

Introduction
In this project, I will create a Dynamic Chart Dashboard using React, Vite, and Chart.js. This dashboard will display various interactive charts (Bar, Line, Scatter, Bubble) based on data fetched from an external file. I will implement reusable chart components, understand Chart.js configuration, and integrate multiple charts into a single application.
